# Upload AI API ðŸš€

Welcome to the server-side of our Upload AI project! This is where all the heavy lifting happens, from processing video uploads to generating AI-powered transcriptions and more. While the frontend might be the face of our project, this backend is the brain and the brawn.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js and Fastify:** For crafting our server and API with speed and efficiency.
- **Prisma:** Our go-to ORM for handling database interactions smoothly.
- **Zod:** For robust validation, making sure our data is in good shape.
- **OpenAI's GPT:** Powers the AI transcriptions and interactions.

## Getting Started

To get this backend up and running:

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/diogoazevedoo/upload-ai-api
```

2. Install the dependencies (make sure you've got Node.js installed):
```bash
cd upload-ai-api
pnpm install
```

3. Create a  `.env`  file in the root of the project with the following content:
```plaintext
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```
This setup uses SQLite for ease of testing, and you'll need to fill in your OpenAI API key.

4. Run the Prisma migration to set up your database schema:
```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

5. Seed your database with prompt templates:
```bash
pnpm prisma db seed
```

6. Fire up the server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
